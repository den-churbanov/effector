```ts
import "effector/enable_debug_traces";
```

A special import that enables detailed traces for difficult-to-debug errors, such as a Store missing a proper SID during Scope serialization.

:::warning{title="Performance cost"}
Debug traces work by capturing additional information when Stores and Events are created.
This introduces a performance overhead during module initialization.

We do not recommend using this API in production environments.
:::

# Debug Trace import (#enable-debug-traces)

To enable debug traces, add `import "effector/enable_debug_traces"` to the entrypoint of your bundle, like this:

```ts
// src/index.ts
import "effector/enable_debug_traces";

// ...rest of your code
```

## When to use it

If you encounter an error that can be diagnosed with this API, you will see a recommendation in the console: `Add "import 'effector/enable_debug_traces'" to your code entry module to see full stack traces`.

Don't forget to remove this import once the issue has been resolved.
