# How to Think in the Effector Paradigm (#how-to-think)

Effector is not just a state manager — it's also a powerful tool for building application logic. Here, we'll go over best practices for writing code and how to approach thinking when using Effector.

## How to approach development with Effector in the right way (#approach)

To use Effector effectively, it's important to grasp a few key principles.

### Events as the Source of Truth (#events-source-of-truth)

An application is a stream of changes. Every change is an event. It's crucial to understand that an event **does not decide what to do** — it simply records that something happened. This is a key point that helps avoid tight dependencies.

- **An event is just a fact**: "something happened."
- **Events contain no logic** — they only declare an occurrence but do not decide how to respond.
- **One fact can lead to multiple consequences** — a single event can trigger several independent processes.

Example:

```ts
// Don't think about implementation yet — just declare the fact
const searchInputChanged = createEvent();
const buttonClicked = createEvent();
```

:::tip{title="Use Meaningful Names"}
Give events meaningful names. For example, if you need to load data upon a certain action, the event should be tied to the action, not its implementation:

```ts
❌ const fetchData = createEvent();
✅ const appStarted = createEvent();
```

### Business Logic and UI Are Separate (#business-logic-not-ui)

A good architectural approach is to keep business logic separate from the user interface. Effector makes this easy, keeping the UI simple and the logic clean and reusable.

- The UI only displays data.
- Effector manages state and logic.

## How Does This Look in a Real Application? (#real-world-examples)

Let's take GitHub as an example, with buttons like "Watch," "Fork," and "Star." Every user action is an event:

![GitHub repository action buttons](/images/github-repo-actions.png)

- The user toggled a star - `repoStarToggled`
- The search input in the repository changed - `repoFileSearchChanged`
- The repository was forked - `repoForked`

The logic is built around events and their reactions. The UI simply announces an action, while its handling is part of the business logic.

A simplified example of the logic behind the star button:

<Tabs>  
<TabItem label="Business Logic">

```ts
// repo.model.ts

// Event – fact of an action
const repoStarToggled = createEvent();

// Effects as additional reactions to events
// (assuming effects return updated values)
const starRepoFx = createEffect(() => {});
const unstarRepoFx = createEffect(() => {});

// Application state
const $isRepoStarred = createStore(false);
const $repoStarsCount = createStore(0);

// Toggle star logic
sample({
  clock: repoStarToggled,
  source: $isRepoStarred,
  fn: (isRepoStarred) => !isRepoStarred,
  target: $isRepoStarred,
});

// Send request to server when star is toggled
sample({
  clock: $isRepoStarred,
  filter: (isRepoStarred) => isRepoStarred,
  target: starRepoFx,
});

sample({
  clock: $isRepoStarred,
  filter: (isRepoStarred) => !isRepoStarred,
  target: unstarRepoFx,
});

// Update the star count
sample({
  clock: [starRepoFx.doneData, unstarRepoFx.doneData],
  target: $repoStarsCount,
});
```

</TabItem>  
<TabItem label="UI">

```tsx
import { repoStarToggled, $isRepoStarred, $repoStarsCount } from "./repo.model.ts";

const RepoStarButton = () => {
  const [onStarToggle, isRepoStarred, repoStarsCount] = useUnit([
    repoStarToggled,
    $isRepoStarred,
    $repoStarsCount,
  ]);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={onStarToggle}>{isRepoStarred ? "unstar" : "star"}</button>
      <span>{repoStarsCount}</span>
    </div>
  );
};
```

</TabItem>  
</Tabs>

At the same time, the UI doesn't need to know what's happening internally — it's only responsible for triggering events and displaying data.
