# Troubleshooting Effector (#troubleshooting)

## Common Errors (#common-errors)

### `store: undefined is used to skip updates. To allow undefined as a value provide explicit { skipVoid: false } option` (#store-undefined)

This error indicates that you are trying to pass `undefined` as a value to your store, which might not be the intended behavior.

If you really need to store `undefined`, pass an object with `{ skipVoid: false }` as the second argument to `createStore`:

```ts
const $store = createStore(0, {
  skipVoid: false,
});
```

### `serialize: One or more stores dont have sids, their values are omitted` (#store-without-sid)

:::info{title="Before version 23.3.0"}
Before version 23.3.0, this error was also known as: `There is a store without sid in this scope, its value is omitted`.
:::

This error commonly occurs in SSR scenarios due to the absence of an `sid` (stable id), which is required for proper hydration of store data from the server to the client.

To fix this, add an `sid` to your store. You can do this in one of the following ways:

1. Use the [Babel](/en/api/effector/babel-plugin/) or [SWC](/en/api/effector/swc-plugin/) plugin to handle it automatically.
2. Manually specify an `sid` by providing an object with a `sid` property as the second argument to `createStore`:

   ```ts
   const $store = createStore(0, {
     sid: "unique id",
   });
   ```

For more details, see [Understanding `sid` and its purpose](/en/explanation/sids).

### `scopeBind: scope not found` (#scope-not-found)

This error occurs when a scope is lost at some point in execution, preventing `scopeBind` from associating an event or effect with the correct execution scope.<br/>
It may be caused by:

1. Using a "scope-free" mode where scopes are not present in your application.
2. Calling [units outside of a scope](#using-units-without-use-unit).

Possible Solutions:

1. Ensure `scopeBind` is used within effects:

   ```ts
   const event = createEvent();

   // ❌ - Do not call scopeBind inside callbacks
   const effectFx = createEffect(() => {
     setTimeout(() => {
       scopeBind(event)();
     }, 1111);
   });

   // ✅ - Use scopeBind inside the effect
   const effectFx = createEffect(() => {
     const scopeEvent = scopeBind(event);

     setTimeout(() => {
       scopeEvent();
     }, 1111);
   });
   ```

2. Ensure that your units are used inside a scope:
   - When working with a framework, use `useUnit`.
   - If calling an event or effect outside a framework, use `allSettled` and provide the appropriate `scope` as an argument.

If necessary, and you want to suppress the error, you can pass `{ safe: true }` as an option:

```ts
const scopeEvent = scopeBind(event, {
  safe: true,
});
```

## Gotchas (#gotchas)

### `sample.fn` does not narrow the type passed from `sample.filter`

A common type-related issue with `sample` occurs when a check is performed inside `filter`, but `fn` does not receive the expected narrowed type.

[Fixing this issue](/en/essentials/typescript#typing-sample-filter-and-fn).

### My state did not change (#my-state-not-changed)

If your state does not update as expected, you are likely working with scopes and, at some point, the active scope was lost. As a result, your unit executed in the global scope instead.<br/>
Find more details about this behavior [here](/en/advanced/work-with-scope).

This issue often occurs when passing units (events or effects) into external function callbacks such as:

- `setTimeout` / `setInterval`
- `addEventListener`
- `webSocket`, etc.

Solution:

Bind your event or effect to the current scope using [`scopeBind`](/en/api/effector/scopeBind):

```ts
const event = createEvent();

// ❌ - This will execute the event in the global scope
const effectFx = createEffect(() => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    event();
  }, 1000);
});

// ✅ - This ensures the event executes in the correct scope
const effectFx = createEffect(() => {
  const scopeEvent = scopeBind(event);
  setTimeout(() => {
    scopeEvent();
  }, 1000);
});
```

#### Using units without `useUnit` (#using-units-without-use-unit)

If you're using events or effects in a framework without `useUnit`, this may also lead to incorrect behavior related to scopes.<br/>
To fix this, pass the unit to the `useUnit` hook and use the returned value:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="❌ Incorrect">

```tsx
import { event } from "./model.js";

const Component = () => {
  return <button onClick={() => event()}></button>;
};
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="✅ Correct">

```tsx
import { event } from "./model.js";
import { useUnit } from "effector-react";

const Component = () => {
  const onEvent = useUnit(event);

  return <button onClick={() => onEvent()}></button>;
};
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
